# Yelp-Friends-Network-Analysis

In this project trying to analyze the friends network then try to predict the network metrics using the user metrics. The reason we are trying to predict network metrics is generating network metrics is very costly especially when the network is very large Once we have predicted the network metrcs we then use concepts of centrality measure to predict if the user is influential or not. Knowing the users influence will help business to market their products or restaurants through these users
